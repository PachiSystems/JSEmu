Or: An Adventure In Emulation For JavaScript
--------------------------------------------

Okay... so this is the thought process behind doing this. I'm a software engineer working on the front end
for a very large company. Most of my work involves CSS and HTML and whilst HTML isn't too bad, CSS tends
to numb my brain... There is some JavaScript stuff and that's where I revel. We use a framework at our
company called TroopJS (you should check it out on GitHub) and I enjoy working with it. However a lot of
the stuff we do is actually in .NET... I'm more familiar with LAMP stacks as opposed to WISA (Windows, IIS,
SQL, ASP.NET).

So that's where this came up. I like fiddling with things in my off-time. I was in my element when I got my
Raspberry Pi and began experimenting with home automation (although that came to an end when we moved to
a smaller apartment and things got packed away) and with the increasing popularity of HTML5 and associated
technologies, I wanted to start building on my knowledge of that as it can only help me in my career.

Browsing the web one day, I noticed there was a GameBoy emulator written in JavaScript and I thought to
myself: "What a great idea!". And then I thought: "I wish I knew how emulators worked internally". That was
quickly followed by: "I want to learn how to build one!". Luckily, this day and age, there are numerous
tutorials on the internet about building emulators. And the vast majority of them are for people who use
C or C++... There was a C# one somewhere and a Java one, but very little in terms of JavaScript. I guess
that even though JavaScript is the most deployed 'language' on the planet, it doesn't get taken too
seriously... Mind you, it is a perfect language for object-oriented programming on the web.
